2015-03-31 11:38:46.529: [INFO] - (TwoThumbs) Kata Changes - Great, your implementation is correct, but all the edge cases are not yet being tested.
Can you find the edge cases that need to be tested?
You are missing the edge case(s):
Have you tested for three numbers?

2015-03-31 11:45:47.445: [INFO] - (TwoThumbs) Kata Changes - Ok, your test is passing now but your implementation is very specific.
Please write a similar test using different value(s) that will require you to improve your implementation.
