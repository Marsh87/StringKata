Please write the implementation to get it passing.

2015-04-01 11:22:00.537: [INFO] - (TwoThumbs) Kata Changes - Great, your implementation is correct, but all the edge cases are not yet being tested.
Can you find the edge cases that need to be tested?
You are missing the edge case(s):
Have you tested that 1000 is not filtered out?
