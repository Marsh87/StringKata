2015-03-19 10:21:01.863: [INFO] - (TwoThumbs) Kata Changes - Great, your implementation is correct, but all the edge cases are not yet being tested.
Can you find the edge cases that need to be tested?
You are missing the edge case(s):
Have you tested for three numbers?
2015-03-19 10:21:23.103: [INFO] - (TwoThumbs) Kata Changes - Great - You might consider refactoring at this point otherwise continue to the next test

Your next test is: Return the negative number using the provided NegativesNotAllowedException
2015-03-19 10:28:21.678: [INFO] - (Warning) Kata Changes - You have a failing test, but there may be an issue with it!
Please ensure your test is correct.
Are you testing that the provided NegativesNotAllowedException is thrown?
Are you verifying that the negative numbers are contained in the NegativeNumbers property?

2015-03-19 10:30:13.178: [INFO] - (TwoThumbs) Kata Changes - Ok, your test is passing now but your implementation is very specific.
Please write a similar test using different value(s) that will require you to improve your implementation.
