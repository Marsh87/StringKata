2015-02-16 09:32:39.127: [INFO] - (TwoThumbs) Kata Changes - Welcome - Please write your first test to start the Kata…
Your first test is: Return zero when an empty string is passed in
2015-02-16 09:39:33.329: [INFO] - (Warning) Kata Changes - ????? Please send your current Kata state to us so that we can figure things out.

2015-02-16 09:43:21.764: [INFO] - (TwoThumbs) Kata Changes - Great - You might consider refactoring at this point otherwise continue to the next test
Your next test is: Return the integer value of the numeric string
2015-02-16 09:46:56.965: [INFO] - (TwoThumbs) Kata Changes - Ok, your test is passing now but your implementation is very specific.
Please write another test so that you can write a more generic implementation.

2015-02-16 09:47:45.173: [INFO] - (Warning) Kata Changes - You are testing too much, is there a simpler test you can write?
You should be testing: Return the integer value of the numeric string
But, you appear to be testing: Sum two numbers
